# Preview

The Preview screen allows you to test screens that you have created. This enables you to send a link for a given screen to a client/user to review and test the screen without authenticating. 

##Note
You must save any changes in order for them to be reflected in the Preview window.

The following animation demonstrates launching a new browser tab to preview:
