#Container Tutorial - Part 3 Custom Elements

So far, we have built two separate components. We have a container with sliding panes and we now have a panel. In this tutorial, we are going to bring it all together by using custom elements and build out our container now with the panels included. Here is a screen shot of the layout we are going to build:
