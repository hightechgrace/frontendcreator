1. Click on the Projects menu item from the **Navigation Menu** on the left.
  ![Step 1][1]

2. Click on the `contact-manager` folder or whatever folder you have to expand it.
  ![Step 2][2]

3. Click on the `src` folder to expand it.
  ![Step 3][3]

4. Click on the `app.js` file to load it.
  ![Step 4][4]

5. Click on the button with the `play` icon to Preview your project in a separate browser tab.
  ![Step 5][5]


Now simply copy the URL from the browser and share it with any users. It should look like the following:

`http://<guid>.blob.core.windows.net/contact-manager/index.html`
