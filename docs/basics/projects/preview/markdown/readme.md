# Markdown Preview
Being able to preview your application is a necessary feature but so is being able to preview your Markdown as you author it. Whenever you open a Markdown file, you are able to preview it exactly as your users would see it. The following is an example of previewing a Markdown file:
1. Click on the `contact-manager` folder or whatever folder you have to expand it.
  ![Step 1][1]

2. Click on the `README.md` file to load it.
  ![Step 2][2]

3. Click on the button with the `eye` icon to Preview your markdown horizontally.
  ![Step 3][3]

4. Click on the button with the `eye` icon again to toggle your Preview vertically.
  ![Step 4][4]

5. Click on the button with the `eye` icon one last time to hide the Preview. You can also click on the blue `X` in the top-right corner of the preview to hide the preview.
  ![Step 5][5]


You also have the ability to toggle styles for your Markdown rendering. This gives you the ability to find the exact style you want for code samples, etc.
## Remember
