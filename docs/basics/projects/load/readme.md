Once you have GitHub Pages setup for your repository, you should see the following:

## Remember
> #### danger::
> You must save any changes in order for them to be reflected in the Preview window.

## Markdown Preview
Being able to preview your application is a necessary feature but so is being able to preview your Markdown as you author it. Whenever you open a Markdown file, you are able to preview it exactly as your users would see it.

Click on the `readme.md` file to load it.
