# Projects

To access your Projects, click on the **Projects** menu item from the Navigation Menu on the left. Think of projects in terms of an application. If you have already created some projects, you will see them listed in the Navigation Panel immediately to the right.

Every project has a project name, description, and front end target. Currently Aurelia is the only supported target but long term plans are that we will be adding more framework targets in the future. Next, you will select a CSS library, Bootstrap is currently the only officially supported CSS framework but long term plans include supporting more of these in the future as well.  Finally, you can add Tags to the project so that it makes it easier to search for it in the future.

If you are adding a new Project, then once you click Save you will see that the Project will appear at the bottom of the Navigation Menu.
