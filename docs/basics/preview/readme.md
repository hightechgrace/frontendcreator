# Preview

**FrontEnd Creator** provides two ways to preview your projects. You have the option to preview your application right along with your editor either horizontally or vertically. You can also preview your project by launching another tab.

## Inline Preview

The following are steps required to preview a project inline:

1. Click on the `contact-manager` folder or whatever folder you have to expand it.

## Sharing Links

The same links that you use to preview your project can be shared with your clients. When you launch the preview in a separate tab, you can copy the link and share it. Using this link requires no authentication from **FrontEnd Creator**.

Take note that this preview screen is outside of routes as no security is enforced. This means that you can only preview one screen at a time statically.
