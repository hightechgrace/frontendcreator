# Preview

**FrontEnd Creator** provides two ways to preview your projects. You have the option to preview your application right along with your editor either horizontally or vertically. You can also preview your project by launching another tab.

## Inline Preview

The following are steps required to preview a project inline:

1. Click on the `contact-manager` folder or whatever folder you have to expand it.

## Sharing Links

The same links that you use to preview your project can be shared with your clients. When you launch the preview in a separate tab, you can copy the link and share it. Using this link requires no authentication from **FrontEnd Creator**.

## Preview Markdown

Being able to preview your application is a necessary feature but so is being able to preview your Markdown as you author it. Whenever you open a Markdown file, you are able to preview it exactly as your users would see it. The following is an example of previewing a Markdown file:

1. Click on the `contact-manager` folder or whatever folder you have to expand it.

2. Click on the `README.md` file to load it.

3. Click on the button with the `eye` icon to Preview your markdown.

5. Click on the button with the `eye` icon one last time to hide the Preview. You can also click on the blue `X` in the top-right corner of the preview to hide the preview.

You also have the ability to toggle styles for your Markdown rendering. This gives you the ability to find the exact style you want for code samples, etc.

## Remember

Take note that this preview screen is outside of routes as no security is enforced. This means that you can only preview one screen at a time statically.
