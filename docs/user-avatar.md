# User Avatar

After you have successfully logged in, you will probably want to set your user profile avatar to something other than the default one as shown below:

![Default Avatar](images/avatar-default.jpg)

You can change this and add your own by following these simple steps:

1. Click on the User button in the top right corner of the application as shown below:

  ![User Button](images/user-button.png)

  It should launch the `User Settings Dialog` as shown below:

2. Next, click on the avatar in the top right corner of the dialog screen to launch the `Set Avatar` dialog:

  ![Set Avatar](images/set-avatar.png)

3. Here, you can paste in a valid URL to an avatar that you would like to use. Once you have entered in a valid URL, you should see a preview of the avatar as shown below:

  ![Avatar Set](images/avatar-set.png)

4. Finally, click the `Submit` button to save your avatar to your user profile.
