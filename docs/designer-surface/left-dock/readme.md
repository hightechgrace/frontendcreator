# Left Dock Pane

The left dock pane contains the following tabs:
*	[Toolbox](toolbox/key-concepts.md) (Drag & Drop capable)
*   [Bootstrap](bootstrap/key-concepts.md)
*   [Components](components/key-concepts.md)
*   [Entities](entities/key-concepts.md)
*   [DOM Tree](dom-tree/key-concepts.md)

The items in these tabs will allow you drag and drop them into the central area. 

You can collapse the pane so that you have more surface to work on as well. The following animation shows how you can toggle the left dock pane:
