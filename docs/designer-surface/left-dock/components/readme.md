# Components Tab

The components provides a list of all of the screens that you have authored for this project. This list is exactly the same as the list on the Project Screens screen. It is available here to allow you to compose hybrid screens by adding them to the designer surface. This promotes component reuse and allows you to mitigate redundancies as much as possible. Also, notice that the icon selected when creating the screen will show up here as well.

The following is a screen shot of the components tab:

> Be aware that you are simply dragging the HTML markup that represents the screen. All Actions, Scripts, and Styles from the original screen are not added.

To add a component on to the designer surface, simply click and drag the element from the components tab onto the designer surface.
