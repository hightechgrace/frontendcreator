# Entities Tab

The entities tab allow you to quickly drag existing entities on to the designer surface with databinding already configured on the fields.

You must have already defined entities using the Entity Builder but you have the option of choosing between for different dynamic configurations:

Type | Description
---- | -----------
Form Edit | Creates a form with editable elements
Form View | Creates a form with non-editable elements
Table Edit | Creates a table with editable elements
Table View | Creates a table with non-editable elements

You also have the ability to toggle selection of entity fields to be include when dragging on to the surface.

Finally, you can drag and drop the entity fields to order them exactly how you would like when dropping the entity on the designer surface.
