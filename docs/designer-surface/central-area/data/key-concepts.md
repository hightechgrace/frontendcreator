# Data Tab

The data tab provides you with the ability to data-bind and test out your screen. It also allows you to pass in data that is considered static and will not be pulled dynamically from a Web API call, etc. 

The following is a screen shot of the data tab:

There will be a whole section dedicated to data and how to use it in your screens.
