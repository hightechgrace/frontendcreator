# HTML Tab

Besides defining layout with the designer tab, you can go into the HTML tab and modify markup there. You can then go back to the designer tab and review your changes or vice versus. You also can preview any of your changes live using the preview tab from the right dock pane.

The following is a screen shot of the HTML tab:

You will find that sometimes it is easier to simply write the HTML you wish. Currently, whenever you make changes in the designer, the HTML is reformatted as a single line per element. This is an area we are working on to improve the workflow.
