# Composition

One thing that makes the FrontEnd Creator powerful is the ability to compose screens together. For every Project, you are able to make as many screens as you like. The term screen here really means component. Sure you can have a route to each screen that you create but it is also possible to compose new screens from previously saved other screens or components. 

This provides for great reuse and flexibility. You will be able to create menu or navigation components that can be reused across all of your screens.
